# Vedic-Math-LLM

This project is still in the idea phase. And also I am planning to work on three projects simultaneously from today, 1. the Vedic Math LLM, 2. Sanskrit LLM, and 3. Vedas & Upanishad LLM. I would like to confess one thing before, that I got very basic knowleadge on Vedic Math, Vedas & Upanishads, Sanskrit. I promise! I definitely gonna research to my ability and be honesty in collection of data. I know I choose the hardest projects that is very difficult to accomplish but I am gonna give my best. I repeat, this is still in the idea phase and I will be working on this projects as close I can. I request any one interested in this ideation and planning to develop similar projects, I appreciate you to contribute, suggestions are always open and lets build better models. Hope we gonna achieve something big soon. As usual keep learning and keep building always 👨‍💻.

I am in plan of maintaining a dairy kind of thing where you can find the daily updates of this three projects in single statement. Caution: Don't expect a detailed explaination in updates as if, I can't put more focus just on documentation. 📃
